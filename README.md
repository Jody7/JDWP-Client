# JDWP-Client
A java "debugger" client. Uses the Oracle VM -Xdebug debugging option. Lets you view stuff from applications...

Just playing around with the JDI and JDWP. Currently it creates a GUI tracking Field Values for your loaded classes. Also tracks
local variables on the Stack! Debugger has a shotgun approach, break point ALL executable lines, and analyze EVERYTHING!
Also prints to console the Call Stack...
